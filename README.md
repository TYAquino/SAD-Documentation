## Proposed System
- Online Registration Form: An easy-to-fill, online registration form for new students.
- Document Upload: Secure upload feature for necessary documents (e.g., birth certificate, previous school records).
- Automated Verification: Automated system for verifying submitted documents and data.
- Status Tracking: Real-time status updates on registration progress.
- Notifications: Automated email/SMS notifications to inform students and parents of registration status and required actions.
- User Accounts: Secure login for students, parents, and administrators.
- Dashboard: Personalized dashboards displaying relevant information (e.g., registration status, upcoming deadlines).
- Information Portal: Access to school policies, academic calendars, and contact information.
- Interactive Forms: Forms for additional requests, feedback, and communication with the school.
- Event Calendar: Display upcoming events, deadlines, and school activities.
- Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly design to ensure accessibility on various devices.
- Data Management: Tools for administrators to view, edit, and manage student records.
- Reporting: Generate reports on registration statistics, student demographics, and other key metrics.
- User Management: Control access levels and permissions for different user roles (e.g., administrators, teachers)
